Building a forex bot to trade on FXCM for our finance course...

THe problem being is a that every time you run the "fxcmpy" connexion function, it takes 20 seconds, which I don't want to wait every time I change something in my script.

So just run the `main.py` file once, and then enter the file name of the script you want to run.

It will then start the "run" function in it, with a single argument, the "connection" object, take the "magic.py" file as an example.
